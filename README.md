This was my first time fully creating a macOS app with AppKit, so there was a lot for me to learn. Thankfully, with my extensive experience in Swift & SwiftUI, it came fairly easily.

There were some parts that were challenging. One was the formatting of the URL bar, such as adding a lock icon for websites secured with https and centering the text vertically, as well as moving it left and center depending on the number of tabs. Another was making sure the favicon and title of each page loaded on the tab view, even if the tab was no longer in the foreground. Through my knowledge of Swift and reading a lot of documentation and StackOverflow posts, I was able to figure these things out.

Overall, this project showed me how much fun I could have working on a browser used by thousands of people, and I'm excited to show what I can bring to the Kagi/Orion team.
